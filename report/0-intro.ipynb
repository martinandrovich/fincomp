    "Generally, the objective is to **develop a theoretically sound model** and **perform pricing** (implement tools), based on a **set of requirements** (portfolio, risk etc.). The model should perform in all kinds of circumstances (market crash, unexpected move etc.).\n",

    "This project case dives into the **fundamentals of computational finance**, herein the basic stochastic processes, stock dynamics models, and pricing of European options using analytical and numerical solutions.\n",
